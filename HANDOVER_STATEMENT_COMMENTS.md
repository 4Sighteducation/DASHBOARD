# Handover Statement: Student Comments Infrastructure

## Summary of Work Completed

### 1. Database Infrastructure
We've successfully created a complete student comments system in Supabase:

#### Tables and Views:
- **student_comments table**: Stores RRC and Goal comments from Object_10 fields
  - Fields: id, student_id, cycle (1-3), comment_type ('rrc'/'goal'), comment_text, knack_field_id
  - Unique constraint on (student_id, cycle, comment_type)
  
- **student_comments_aggregated view**: Joins comments with student/establishment data for easy filtering

#### Functions:
- **get_word_cloud_data()**: Generates word frequencies with HTML stripping and stop word filtering
- **strip_html()**: Helper function to remove HTML tags from text

### 2. Sync Integration
Modified `sync_knack_to_supabase.py` to sync comments from Object_10:

#### Knack Field Mappings:
```
Object_10 (vespa_results) comment fields:
- field_2302: RRC Cycle 1
- field_2303: RRC Cycle 2  
- field_2304: RRC Cycle 3
- field_2499: Goal Cycle 1
- field_2493: Goal Cycle 2
- field_2494: Goal Cycle 3
```

#### Key Points:
- Comments are synced during the same pass as students/VESPA scores
- HTML tags are preserved in the database
- Batch processing with 200 comments per batch
- Uses Object_10 ID as the knack_id (correct approach)

### 3. Current Status
- ✅ Database tables created and working
- ✅ Sync script updated and tested
- ✅ Word cloud function working with HTML stripping
- ✅ RLS temporarily disabled for initial sync
- ⏳ Full sync running (will populate all historical comments)

### 4. Vue Dashboard Integration

#### Two Separate Word Clouds Needed:
1. **RRC Comments Word Cloud** - Reading, Recall, Comprehension feedback
2. **Goals Word Cloud** - Student goals and aspirations

#### Colors to Match:
```javascript
const wordCloudColors = ['#ff8f00', '#86b4f0', '#72cb44', '#7f31a4', '#f032e6', '#ffd93d'];
```

#### Suggested Implementation:
```vue
<template>
  <div class="comments-section">
    <div class="word-cloud-tabs">
      <button @click="activeTab = 'rrc'" :class="{active: activeTab === 'rrc'}">
        RRC Comments
      </button>
      <button @click="activeTab = 'goal'" :class="{active: activeTab === 'goal'}">
        Goals
      </button>
    </div>
    
    <WordCloud 
      :type="activeTab"
      :establishment-id="currentEstablishmentId"
      :cycle="selectedCycle"
      :filters="activeFilters"
    />
  </div>
</template>
```

### 5. Important Notes

#### Authentication:
- Sync uses anon key (not ideal but works with RLS disabled)
- Consider using service role key in production

#### Data Quality:
- Comments contain HTML tags (preserved for formatting)
- Word cloud function strips HTML automatically
- Some comments may be empty or very short

#### Performance:
- First sync will process ~25k students' comments
- Subsequent syncs only update changes
- Word cloud limited to top 100 words

### 6. Next Steps for New Context

1. **Complete the sync** - Let it run to populate all comments
2. **Re-enable RLS** after sync completes:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE student_comments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

3. **Create Vue components**:
   - WordCloud.vue (using wordcloud2.js or similar)
   - WordCloudTabs.vue (toggle between RRC/Goals)
   - CommentsSection.vue (container)

4. **Test word cloud function**:
   ```javascript
   const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_word_cloud_data', {
     p_comment_type: 'rrc',
     p_cycle: 1
   })
   ```

5. **Implement filtering** - The function supports all dashboard filters

### 7. Files to Reference
- `create_student_comments_table.sql` - Database schema
- `sync_knack_to_supabase.py` - Lines 508-544 for comment sync logic
- `dashboard-frontend/src/dashboard4c.js` - Lines 6876-7089 for original implementation
- `VUE_DASHBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Updated with comments section

### 8. Known Issues/Considerations
- Some students may not have comments
- HTML entities (&nbsp;, &amp;) are handled by the function
- Stop words list can be customized in the PostgreSQL function
- Consider caching word cloud results (they're computationally expensive)

This completes the student comments infrastructure. The backend is fully ready for the Vue dashboard to consume the data through the `get_word_cloud_data` function.
