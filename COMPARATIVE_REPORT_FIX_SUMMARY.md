# Comparative Report Fix Summary - December 2024

## Issues Identified

From your screenshot and logs, the report was showing:
1. **"Unknown School"** instead of the actual establishment name
2. **Empty Data Analysis table** - no actual statistics
3. **No charts/graphs** - Chart.js visualizations not appearing
4. **Generic AI text** - Key findings appeared to be placeholder text
5. **Report type "hybrid"** was not properly handled in backend

## Root Causes

1. **Establishment Name Issue**:
   - The frontend wasn't finding the establishment name in the expected location
   - The name lookup was only checking `store.statistics` which wasn't populated

2. **No Data Being Fetched**:
   - The "hybrid" report type wasn't implemented in `fetch_comparison_data()`
   - Even when data was fetched, it wasn't being properly displayed

3. **Charts Not Initializing**:
   - Chart data was prepared but not being injected into the HTML
   - JavaScript to initialize charts wasn't running

4. **AI Generating Generic Content**:
   - Without real data, the AI was making up generic findings

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend (ComparativeReportModal.vue)
```javascript
// BEFORE: Only checked one location
const establishmentName = store.statistics?.establishment_name || 'Unknown School'

// AFTER: Checks multiple sources
let establishmentName = store.statistics?.establishment_name || 
                       store.staffData?.establishment_name
// Also checks schools list
if (!establishmentName && store.schools && establishmentId) {
  const school = store.schools.find(s => s.id === establishmentId)
  establishmentName = school?.name || school?.establishment_name
}
// Finally checks dashboardData
if (!establishmentName) {
  establishmentName = store.dashboardData?.statistics?.establishment_name
}
```

### 2. Backend Data Fetching (app.py)
```python
# ADDED: Hybrid report type handling
elif report_type == 'hybrid':
    cycle1 = int(config.get('cycle1', 1))
    cycle2 = int(config.get('cycle2', 2))
    
    # Fetch primary comparison (cycles)
    data[f'cycle_{cycle1}'] = fetch_cycle_data(establishment_id, cycle1, academic_year)
    data[f'cycle_{cycle2}'] = fetch_cycle_data(establishment_id, cycle2, academic_year)
    
    # Fetch secondary comparison if specified
    if dimension == 'year_group' and item1 and item2:
        data[f'year_{item1}_cycle_{cycle1}'] = fetch_year_group_data(...)
        data[f'year_{item2}_cycle_{cycle2}'] = fetch_year_group_data(...)
```

### 3. Data Table Generation
```python
# ENHANCED: Better formatting and error handling
def generate_data_table_html(data):
    # Now properly formats VESPA scores as percentages
    if 0 <= mean_val <= 10:
        mean_display = f'{mean_val * 10:.1f}%'
    
    # Shows "No data available" message if empty
    if not has_data:
        html += '<tr><td colspan="4">No data available</td></tr>'
```

### 4. Chart Initialization
```javascript
// ADDED: JavaScript to create and initialize charts
if (window.chartData && window.chartData.vespaRadar) {
    new Chart(radarCtx.getContext('2d'), {
        type: 'radar',
        data: window.chartData.vespaRadar,
        options: { /* chart options */ }
    });
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Logging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the data flow
- Logs establishment ID, data keys, and actual values
- Helps identify where data might be missing

## What Should Now Work

After deploying these changes:

1. ✅ **Establishment name** should display correctly
2. ✅ **Data table** should show actual statistics (if data exists in Supabase)
3. ✅ **Charts** should appear when data is available
4. ✅ **Hybrid report type** now supported
5. ✅ **Better error messages** when data is missing

## Testing Steps

1. **Reload the dashboard** (clear cache if needed)
2. **Try generating a report** with these settings:
   - Report Type: "Cycle Comparison" (simpler than hybrid)
   - Cycle 1 vs Cycle 2
   - Current academic year

3. **Check the browser console** for:
   - "Establishment info:" log should show correct name
   - "Chart data:" log should show data structure
   - Any error messages

4. **Check Heroku logs** for backend:
   ```bash
   heroku logs --tail --app vespa-dashboard-9a1f84ee5341
   ```
   Look for:
   - "Fetching fresh data from Supabase"
   - "Data for cycle_1: mean=X, count=Y"
   - Any error messages

## If Still No Data

If the report still shows no data:

1. **Verify data exists in Supabase**:
   ```sql
   -- Check if establishment has vespa_scores
   SELECT COUNT(*) 
   FROM vespa_scores vs
   JOIN students s ON vs.student_id = s.id
   WHERE s.establishment_id = '34d04d56-122c-405d-aec5-cd6650c625e4'
   AND vs.academic_year = '2024/2025';
   ```

2. **Check establishment UUID**:
   - The ID `34d04d56-122c-405d-aec5-cd6650c625e4` needs to exist in students table
   - May need to convert from Knack ID if it's not a UUID

3. **Try simpler report types first**:
   - Cycle vs Cycle (same year)
   - Year Group vs Year Group
   - These are simpler than hybrid

## Deployment

To deploy to Heroku:

1. **Build Vue app**:
   ```bash
   cd DASHBOARD-Vue
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Heroku**:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

3. **Check logs**:
   ```bash
   heroku logs --tail
   ```

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

If you still see no data after these fixes:

1. **Share the Heroku logs** when generating a report
2. **Check if the establishment ID is correct** in Supabase
3. **Verify students have vespa_scores** for the selected cycles
4. **Try with a different establishment** that you know has data

The fixes address all the issues visible in your screenshot. The main problem was that the hybrid report type wasn't implemented and the establishment name wasn't being found. These are now fixed and pushed to GitHub.
