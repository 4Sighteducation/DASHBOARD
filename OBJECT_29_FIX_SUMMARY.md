# Object_29 Field Mapping Fix Summary

## 🐛 The Problem

The sync was looking for `field_1819` in Object_29, which **doesn't exist**. This caused 0 question responses to sync.

## 🔍 What We Discovered

### Correct Object Relationships:
```
Object_6 (Students) ← Object_10 (VESPA Results) ← Object_29 (Statement Responses)
                           ↑                           ↑
                           └───── field_792 ───────────┘
                                (email connection)
```

### Key Fields in Object_29:
- **field_792**: Connection to Object_10 (email-based)
- **field_2732**: Email field
- **field_1953**: Cycle 1 indicator
- **field_1955**: Cycle 2 indicator  
- **field_1956**: Cycle 3 indicator
- **field_2070**: Tutor connection (not needed in sync)
- **field_1824**: Group field (not needed in sync)

### What was wrong:
- Code was looking for `field_1819_raw` (doesn't exist)
- Should use `field_792_raw` to get Object_10 connection
- Then map Object_10 ID → Student ID

## ✅ The Fix

Changed all sync scripts from:
```python
student_field = record.get('field_1819_raw', [])
```

To:
```python
object_10_field = record.get('field_792_raw', [])
```

## 📋 Fixed Files:
1. `sync_knack_to_supabase_optimized.py`
2. `sync_knack_to_supabase_backend.py`
3. `sync_knack_to_supabase.py`

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. Run the quick sync to get question responses:
```bash
python quick_sync_questions_and_stats.py
```

2. Or clear checkpoint and run full sync with fixes:
```bash
rm sync_checkpoint.pkl
python sync_knack_to_supabase_optimized.py
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned:

1. Object_29 connects to Object_10, not directly to students
2. Students in our database were created from Object_10 records
3. The knack_id in students table = Object_10 record ID
4. Always verify field mappings before assuming!
