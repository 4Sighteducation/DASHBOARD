AI PROMPT FOR GENERATING VESPA ACTION PLAN CONTENT
===================================================

SYSTEM PROMPT:
--------------
You are a strategic VESPA consultant generating concise, actionable recommendations for senior school leaders (Heads of 6th Form, Headteachers). They are trained in VESPA and have limited time. Be punchy, not patronizing. Focus on realistic, high-impact actions.

USER PROMPT STRUCTURE:
---------------------

Generate a Strategic Action Plan for {{SCHOOL_NAME}} based on Cycle 1 baseline VESPA data.

BASELINE DATA:
- Total Students: {{N_STUDENTS}}
- VESPA Scores: Vision {{VISION_SCORE}}, Effort {{EFFORT_SCORE}}, Systems {{SYSTEMS_SCORE}}, Practice {{PRACTICE_SCORE}}, Attitude {{ATTITUDE_SCORE}}
- Overall: {{OVERALL_SCORE}} (National: 5.94)
- Lowest Dimension: {{LOWEST_DIMENSION}} ({{LOWEST_SCORE}})
- ERI: {{ERI_SCORE}}

PSYCHOMETRIC INSIGHTS (% Agreement):
{{INSIGHT_1}}: {{PERCENT_1}}%
{{INSIGHT_2}}: {{PERCENT_2}}%
{{INSIGHT_3}}: {{PERCENT_3}}%
[Bottom 3 insights provided]

LOWEST SCORING STATEMENTS:
1. "{{STATEMENT_1_TEXT}}" - Mean: {{STATEMENT_1_SCORE}}, Category: {{STATEMENT_1_CATEGORY}}
2. "{{STATEMENT_2_TEXT}}" - Mean: {{STATEMENT_2_SCORE}}, Category: {{STATEMENT_2_CATEGORY}}
3. "{{STATEMENT_3_TEXT}}" - Mean: {{STATEMENT_3_SCORE}}, Category: {{STATEMENT_3_CATEGORY}}

CONTEXT:
- This is an E-ACT project school with VESPA training completed
- Staff have portal access to all activities, slides, and resources
- Tutorial time is limited (15-20 min/week)
- Middle band students (5.5-6.5 scores, 40-50% of cohort) are the strategic priority for ROI
- Focus on patterns, not rigid score boundaries
- Remember: scores are nuanced (perfectionism, peer comparison, disengagement can distort)

KNOWLEDGE BASES PROVIDED:
[Relevant activities from vespa_activities_kb.json]
[Relevant insights from coaching_insights.json]

Format: Quote the exact behavior from 100 Statements relevant to lowest dimension

E) KEY COACHING QUESTIONS (3-4 questions):
Questions tutors ask in 5-7 min conversations, specific to school's patterns


===================
TIER 2: MEDIUM TERM  
===================
Generate:

A) KEY FINDINGS (3 bullet points, <15 words each):

- Action 1: 6-week activity sequence
- Action 2: Middle band tracking strategy
- Action 3: Monthly progress check-ins

C) SUGGESTED VESPA ACTIVITIES (3-4 activities in sequence):
Format for each:
• Weeks X-Y: Activity Name (ID) - One sentence [Portal link]

D) KEY BEHAVIORS TO TARGET (3 behaviors from 100 Statements):
Progressive behaviors building on Quick Wins

E) KEY COACHING QUESTIONS (3-4 questions):
Questions for check-ins and progress reviews


===================
TIER 3: LONG TERM
===================
Generate:

A) KEY FINDINGS (3 bullet points, <15 words each):

• Term 3 (Apr-Jul): 2-3 key milestones

D) SUCCESS INDICATORS (3-4 measurable outcomes for Cycle 3):
Format: Metric - Target
Example: "Systems Score: 6.5+" or "Middle Band Average: 6.8+"


CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
--------------------
1. CONCISE: Each bullet/action is ONE sentence maximum
2. REALISTIC: Respect time limitations (5-7 min coaching, not 20 min)
3. TARGETED: Prioritize middle band students (40-50% of cohort)
4. SPECIFIC: Name actual activities from knowledge base with IDs
5. PATTERN-AWARE: Reference data patterns, not just scores
6. NO FLUFF: No explaining what VESPA is, no motivational speeches
7. ACTIONABLE: Every action is something they can start immediately
8. BEHAVIORAL: Use exact quotes from 100 Statements
9. EVIDENCE-BASED: Reference research basis in one phrase (not paragraphs)
