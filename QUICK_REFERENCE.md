# Quick Reference - Archive Fix Project

## üéØ The Problem (In Plain English)
Dashboard broken since academic year started (Sept 2025) because:
1. Sync script tags everything as 2025/2026 (even old data)
2. Historical 2024/2025 data being overwritten
3. No archive protection in place

## ‚úÖ The Solution
1. Import August 2025 snapshot as archive (2024/2025)
2. Fix sync to calculate academic year from DATA dates not TODAY's date
3. Protect archive from future overwrites

## üìÅ Files I Created For You

### Must Read First
- `ARCHIVE_FIX_DEEP_DIVE_ANALYSIS.md` - Full technical analysis
- `IMMEDIATE_NEXT_STEPS.md` - What to do next

### Scripts to Run
- `audit_current_database_state.py` - Check database NOW
- `analyze_csv_snapshot.py` - Analyze your CSV files

## üèÉ What You Do RIGHT NOW

### 1. Run Database Audit (5 mins)
```bash
cd "C:\Users\tonyd\OneDrive - 4Sight Education Ltd\Apps\DASHBOARD\DASHBOARD"
python audit_current_database_state.py
```
This shows what's in database now (before we change anything)

### 2. Run CSV Analysis (5 mins)
```bash
python analyze_csv_snapshot.py
```
This shows what's in your August snapshot files

### 3. Tell Me Results
Key things I need to know:
- How many students shown for 2024/2025 in database now?
- How many students shown for 2025/2026 in database now?
- What date range is in the Object_10 CSV file?
- Which sync script is actually running daily?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### About Your CSV Files
- ‚úÖ **Object_10** (2.5M records) = VESPA results - THIS IS WHAT WE NEED
- ‚ùå Object_6 (23K records) = User accounts - NOT the main data
- ‚úÖ Object_29 (41K records) = Question responses - Also need this

### About Safety
- I will NOT change database without your approval
- We'll test on 100 records first
- Backup database before any imports
- Can rollback if needed

## üìä Expected Timeline

- **Today:** Run audits, review results
- **Day 2:** Create & test import script
- **Day 3:** Run full import of archive
- **Day 4:** Fix and deploy sync repair
- **Day 5:** Validate everything works

## ‚ùì Quick Questions
1. Expected student count for 2024/2025? 
2. Expected student count for 2025/2026?
3. Which sync script runs daily? (sync_knack_to_supabase.py?)
4. Can you backup Supabase database?

## üé¨ After You Run The Scripts

Share with me:
1. The generated JSON file (database_audit_*.json)
2. OR just tell me the key numbers you see
3. Answers to the questions above

Then I'll create the import script with exact field mappings!

---
**Bottom Line:** This is fixable. Run the 2 scripts, share results, then we build the fix together.
