# Deep Dive Findings - Executive Summary
**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Analysis Complete

---

## 🎉 **Great News First!**

1. ✅ **National averages script WORKS** - Just needed load_dotenv() + scheduler path update
2. ✅ **Academic year calculation function is CORRECT**
3. ✅ **Scripts DO try to use completion dates**
4. ✅ **Email-based student mapping already exists**
5. ✅ **Database constraints are NOW fixed** for multi-year support

---

## 🔍 **What We Found in sync_knack_to_supabase.py**

### **The Good** ✅

- Uses field_855 (VESPA completion date)
- Uses field_856 (Question completion date)
- Has email-based student lookup
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Handles Object_10 → Object_29 linking
- calculate_academic_year function is solid

### **The Problems** 🚨

Found **5 Critical Issues** preventing proper multi-year support:

---

## 🚨 **Issue #1: Students Upsert Constraint Mismatch**

**The Problem:**
```python
# Database has: UNIQUE(email, academic_year)
# Script uses: on_conflict='email'  ❌ MISMATCH!
```

**Impact:**
- Can't insert same email for different years
- Student from 2024/2025 blocks same email in 2025/2026
- **This is why your import skipped 20,023 students!**

**The Fix:**
```python
on_conflict='email,academic_year'  # Must match database
```

**Locations:** Lines 473 and 626 (2 places)

---

## 🚨 **Issue #2: Question Responses Missing Academic Year**

**The Problem:**
```python
response_data = {
    'student_id': student_id,
    'cycle': cycle,
    'question_id': q_detail['questionId'],
    'response_value': int_value
    # ❌ No 'academic_year' field!
}
```

**Impact:**
- Question responses have no academic year assigned
- Can't differentiate 2024/2025 from 2025/2026
- Constraint failures

**The Fix:**
- Calculate academic_year from field_856 (Object_29 completion date)
- Add to response_data dictionary

---

## 🚨 **Issue #3: Question Responses Upsert Constraint**

**The Problem:**
```python
# Database has: UNIQUE(student_id, cycle, academic_year, question_id)
# Script uses: on_conflict='student_id,cycle,question_id'  ❌ MISSING academic_year!
```

**Impact:**
- **This causes the 13K skipped responses!**
- Student who answered Q1/Cycle1 in 2024/2025 can't answer it in 2025/2026

**The Fix:**
```python
on_conflict='student_id,cycle,academic_year,question_id'
```

**Locations:** Lines 826 and 853 (2 places)

---

## 🚨 **Issue #4: Fallback to Current Date**

**The Problem:**
```python
# If field_855 is NULL (95% of records):
academic_year = calculate_academic_year(
    datetime.now().strftime('%d/%m/%Y')  # ❌ Uses TODAY!
)
```

**Impact:**
- All records with NULL field_855 get current year (2025/2026)
- Historical data gets wrong academic year
- Archive data corrupted

**The Fix:**
```python
# Priority:
# 1. field_855 (completion date)
# 2. 'created' date (from Knack)
# 3. Current date (last resort)

if field_855:
    use field_855
elif record['created']:
    use created date  # ✅ Better than current date!
else:
    use current date
```

---

## 🚨 **Issue #5: Float/Integer Type Mismatches**

**The Problem:**
```
Error: 'invalid input syntax for type integer: "6.0"'
```

**Impact:**
- VESPA score imports fail
- Data loss

**The Fix:**
- Ensure int() conversion for Vision, Effort, Systems, Practice, Attitude
- Keep float() for Overall

---

## 📊 **Why These Issues Cause Your Problems**

### **Problem: 13K Question Responses Skipped**
**Root Causes:**
- Issue #2: No academic_year field
- Issue #3: Wrong constraint
- Students missing from database (Issue #1)

### **Problem: Daily Sync Adding Too Many Students**
**Root Cause:**
- Issue #1: Can't match on (email + academic_year)
- Creates duplicates instead of updating

### **Problem: Historical Data Being Overwritten**
**Root Cause:**
- Issue #4: NULL dates → current year
- Everything becomes 2025/2026

---

## ✅ **The Solution**

**All 5 fixes are straightforward code changes!**

No complex logic needed - just:
1. Match on_conflict to database constraints
2. Add academic_year field to question responses
3. Use 'created' date as fallback
