# Guide to Modifying Questionnaire Insights

## Overview
To change which questions are included in each insight, you need to update **3 locations**:

## 1. Frontend Display (InsightDetailModal.vue)
**File**: `DASHBOARD-Vue/src/components/QLA/InsightDetailModal.vue`
**Lines**: 75-176

This controls what question text is shown in the modal when users click on an insight.

### Example Structure:
```javascript
time_management: {
  description: 'Students ability to effectively plan...',
  importance: 'Good time management reduces stress...',
  questions: {
    'q2': 'I complete all my homework on time',
    'q4': 'I start my work promptly rather than procrastinating', 
    'q11': 'I plan and organise my time to get my work done'
  }
}
```

## 2. Backend API Configuration (app.py)
**File**: `app.py`
**Lines**: ~6391-6450

This controls which questions are used to calculate the percentage scores.

### Example Structure:
```python
'time_management': {
    'title': 'Time Management',
    'question_ids': ['q2', 'q4', 'q11'],  # Must match frontend
    'icon': '⏰',
    'question': 'What percentage manage their time effectively?'
}
```

## 3. Frontend Fallback Data (api.js)
**File**: `DASHBOARD-Vue/src/services/api.js`
**Lines**: ~336-348

This provides fallback data if the API fails.

### Example Structure:
```javascript
{ 
  id: 'time_management', 
  title: 'Time Management', 
  percentageAgreement: 0, 
  questionIds: ['q2', 'q4', 'q11'],  // Must match backend
  icon: '⏰', 
  totalResponses: 0 
}
```

## Available Questions
Here are all questions you can use (must use lowercase IDs):

## Steps to Modify an Insight

### Example: Changing Time Management to focus on procrastination
1. **Update Frontend Display** (`InsightDetailModal.vue`):
```javascript
time_management: {
  questions: {
    'q4': 'I start my work promptly rather than procrastinating',
    'q11': 'I plan and organise my time to get my work done',
    'q24': 'I always study in places where I can concentrate'
  }
}
```

2. **Update Backend API** (`app.py`):
```python
'time_management': {
    'question_ids': ['q4', 'q11', 'q24'],
    # ... rest stays the same
}
```

3. **Update Frontend Fallback** (`api.js`):
```javascript
{ 
  id: 'time_management',
  questionIds: ['q4', 'q11', 'q24'],
  // ... rest stays the same
}
```

4. **Rebuild Frontend**:
```bash
cd DASHBOARD-Vue
npm run build
```

5. **Commit and Deploy**:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Update time management insight questions"
git push
```

## Important Notes
- Always use **lowercase** question IDs (q1, not Q1)
- Keep the same question IDs in all 3 locations
- The percentage calculation uses the distribution arrays from `question_statistics`
- Questions with scores 4 and 5 count as "agreement"
- After changes, the statistics don't need recalculating - the API dynamically calculates percentages

## Testing
After making changes:
1. Check the insight modal displays the correct question text
2. Verify the percentage calculations use the new questions
3. Test on different academic years/cycles to ensure consistency

## Notes on Current Configuration
- **q7** appears in both "Study Effectiveness" and "Active Learning"
- **q8** appears in both "Resilience Factor" and "Academic Confidence"
- **q2** appears in both "Organization Skills" and "Time Management"
- **q11** appears in both "Organization Skills" and "Time Management"
- This overlap is intentional as these questions contribute to multiple psychological constructs
