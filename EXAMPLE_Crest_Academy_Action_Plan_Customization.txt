EXAMPLE PATTERN-BASED COACHING QUESTIONS:
-----------------------------------------
For Crest Academy's specific concerns, use:

Systems (6.03) - Primary focus:
- "How do you currently manage your time and commitments?"
- "What makes it difficult to stay organized?"
- "When do you feel most in control of your workload?"

Active Learning (45%) - Secondary focus:
- "Walk me through your last revision session - what did you actually DO?"
- "Do you mostly re-read notes, or test yourself?"
- "When you say you 'revised for 2 hours' - what were you doing?"


NOTES FOR PYTHON AUTOMATION:
---------------------------
When you build the Python script, it should:
1. Read school baseline data
2. Identify lowest VESPA dimension
3. Identify lowest 2-3 psychometric insights
4. Match to relevant activities from vespa_activities_kb.json
5. Match to relevant coaching questions from coaching_insights.json
6. Extract relevant behaviors from 100 statements - 2023.txt
7. Fill all placeholders
8. Output customized Action Plan HTML

The template structure remains constant - only data changes per school.
