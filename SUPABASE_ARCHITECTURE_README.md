## Executive Summary

We're migrating the VESPA Dashboard from direct Knack API calls to a Supabase-powered data warehouse. This solves critical performance issues while enabling powerful new features like comparative analytics and AI insights.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ No more 1000 student limit
- ✅ 100x faster load times
- ✅ Real-time statistics calculations
- ✅ Enables advanced analytics features

---

## Why This Change?

### Current Problems with Knack API:
1. **Hard limit of 1000 records per page** - Schools with 2000+ students couldn't load all data
2. **Slow sequential API calls** - 30+ seconds to load dashboard for large schools
3. **No complex queries** - Can't compare groups, cycles, or calculate statistics efficiently
4. **Rate limiting** - Risk of hitting API limits during peak usage

### Solution: Data Warehouse Pattern
- **Sync data to PostgreSQL** (via Supabase) every 6 hours
- **Pre-calculate statistics** during sync
- **Query optimized database** instead of API
- **Keep Knack for auth only**

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```
establishments (schools)
    ├── students
    │   ├── vespa_scores (by cycle)
    │   └── question_responses
    ├── school_statistics (pre-calculated)
    └── question_statistics

Pre-calculated Views:
- student_vespa_progress
- current_school_averages
- comparative_analysis (new)
```

### API Endpoint Changes
```python
# OLD (Knack):
@app.route('/api/dashboard-data/<establishment_id>')
def get_dashboard_data(establishment_id):
    data = make_knack_request('object_10', filters=filters)
    # ... complex processing ...
    return processed_data

# NEW (Supabase):
@app.route('/api/dashboard-data/<establishment_id>')
def get_dashboard_data(establishment_id):
    # Pre-calculated, instant response!
    data = supabase.table('current_school_averages') \
        .select('*') \
        .eq('establishment_id', establishment_id) \
        .execute()
    return data.data
```

### Performance Improvements
| Metric | Before (Knack) | After (Supabase) |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Load time (1000 students) | 15-20s | <1s |
| Load time (3000 students) | Failed | <2s |
| Max students | 1000 | Unlimited |
