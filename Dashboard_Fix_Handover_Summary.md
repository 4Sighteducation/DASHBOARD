# Dashboard Fix Handover Summary

## Date: 2025-08-04

## Original Problem
The Vue Dashboard in Knack was not displaying any data despite the backend returning 200 OK responses. Error message: "No establishment selected" even after selecting an establishment.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. API Returning Null Values
**Problem**: The `/api/statistics` endpoint was returning `null` for `academic_year` and `cycle` fields.
**Cause**: The API was returning request parameters (which were null) instead of actual database values.
**Location**: `app.py` lines 4748-4754

### 2. Academic Year Mismatch
**Problem**: Data in `school_statistics` and `national_statistics` tables marked as "2025-26" instead of "2024-25".
**Cause**: The sync script was using `datetime.now()` (current date when sync runs) instead of actual completion dates from the data.
**Impact**: Dashboard couldn't find any statistics data because it was looking for the wrong academic year.

## Investigation Findings

### Database Investigation Results
```sql
-- vespa_scores: CORRECT - Shows proper academic years based on completion dates
-- Academic years found: 2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-24, 2024-25 (latest)

-- school_statistics: WRONG - All marked as 2025-26
-- Reason: Calculated on 2025-08-02, used current date instead of data dates

-- national_statistics: WRONG - All marked as 2025-26 
-- Same issue as school_statistics

-- question_statistics: CORRECT - Shows 2024/2025 (note different format with slash)
-- Uses stored procedure that works correctly
```

### Key Discovery
The sync was run on August 2nd, 2025. Since it's after August 1st, the sync incorrectly marked all statistics as academic year "2025-26" even though the actual student data is from "2024-25".

## Fixes Applied

### 1. API Fix (app.py) - NOT NEEDED
**File**: `app.py`
**Status**: NO CHANGES REQUIRED - The API is working correctly.
**Note**: Initially thought this was needed but the actual issue is just the data having wrong academic year values.

### 2. Sync Script Fix (sync_knack_to_supabase.py)
**File**: `sync_knack_to_supabase.py`
**Changes**: Modified statistics calculation to use actual data dates instead of current date.

#### In calculate_statistics() function:
```python
# OLD - Uses current date
current_year = calculate_academic_year(datetime.now().strftime('%d/%m/%Y'), ...)

# NEW - Gets actual academic years from data
academic_years_result = supabase.table('vespa_scores')\
    .select('academic_year')\
    .in_('student_id', student_ids)\
    .execute()
academic_years = list(set([r['academic_year'] for r in academic_years_result.data]))
```

#### In calculate_national_statistics() function:
Similar fix - queries actual academic years from school_statistics instead of using current date.

### 3. SQL Data Fix (fix_academic_year_data.sql)
**File**: `fix_academic_year_data.sql`
**Purpose**: Updates existing incorrect data from "2025-26" to "2024-25"
```sql
-- Updates school_statistics
UPDATE school_statistics
SET academic_year = '2024-25'
WHERE academic_year = '2025-26';

-- Updates national_statistics  
UPDATE national_statistics
SET academic_year = '2024-25'
WHERE academic_year = '2025-26';
```

### 4. Frontend Debug Logging
**Files**: `DASHBOARD-Vue/src/stores/dashboard.js`, `DASHBOARD-Vue/src/App.vue`
**Purpose**: Added console.log statements to trace establishment selection and data loading flow.
**Build Version**: vuedash1l.js/css (cache-busted version)

## Files Created/Modified

1. **sync_knack_to_supabase.py** - Already has fixes to use actual data dates for statistics
2. **fix_academic_year_data.sql** - SQL script to fix existing data
3. **investigate_academic_years.sql** - SQL queries used for investigation
4. **DASHBOARD-Vue/src/stores/dashboard.js** - Added debug logging
5. **DASHBOARD-Vue/src/App.vue** - Added debug logging
6. **DASHBOARD-Vue/vite.config.js** - Updated to build vuedash1l version

## Action Items Required

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Run SQL Fix**: Execute `fix_academic_year_data.sql` in Supabase to update existing data
2. **Update Knack**: Manually update Knack custom code to load vuedash1l.js/css (for debug logging)

### Testing:
1. After SQL fix, test dashboard data loading
2. Verify establishment selection works
3. Check that statistics display correctly

### Future Considerations:
1. **Academic Year Format**: Some tables use "2024-25", others use "2024/2025" - consider standardizing
2. **Academic Year Selector**: Add UI element to select different academic years
3. **Sync Schedule**: Ensure sync script changes are deployed before next scheduled sync

## Technical Notes

- The sync script correctly uses completion dates (field_855) for individual records
- The issue only affected aggregated statistics tables
- UK academic year runs August to July (Aug 2024 - Jul 2025 = "2024-25")
- Australian schools use calendar year (different calculation in sync script)

## Status Summary

✅ Root causes identified
✅ Sync script already has correct fixes
✅ SQL data fix created
⏳ Awaiting SQL execution to fix existing data
⏳ Frontend testing pending after SQL fix
