üîç FINDINGS:

Object_29 (Question Responses):
  ‚ùå {len(missing_obj29):,} unique student emails NOT in Supabase
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  {len(skipped):,} question responses would be skipped
  
Object_10 (VESPA Results) - Sample:
  ‚ùå {len(missing_obj10):,} student emails NOT in Supabase (from sample)

LIKELY CAUSES:
1. Students in Knack haven't synced to Supabase yet
2. Students were deleted from Supabase during cleanup
3. Email format mismatches (case, spaces)
4. Old academic year students removed

RECOMMENDATION:
{'‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: Many students are missing from Supabase!' if len(missing_obj29) > 1000 else '‚úÖ Only minor missing student issues'}
{'   The archive import will help populate historical students.' if len(missing_obj29) > 1000 else ''}
{'   Current sync may need student re-import from Object_10.' if len(missing_obj10) > 100 else ''}

NEXT STEPS:
1. Run the archive import (will add 2024-2025 students)
2. Check if sync is properly importing from Object_10
3. Consider one-time sync of all current Object_10 students
