# Knack to Supabase Sync Optimization Guide

## üö® Problem Solved

Your sync timed out because:
1. **No batch processing** - Making individual API calls for each record
2. **PC went to sleep** - Windows put the computer to sleep during long sync
3. **No resume capability** - Had to start over after timeout
4. **Inefficient queries** - Repeated database lookups for each record

## ‚ú® New Features in Optimized Sync

### 1. **Batch Processing**
- Students: 100 records per batch
- VESPA scores: 500 records per batch  
- Question responses: 1000 records per batch
- Reduces API calls by 90%+ 

### 2. **Resume Capability**
- Saves progress to `sync_checkpoint.pkl`
- Can resume exactly where it left off
- No lost work on timeout/interruption

### 3. **System Sleep Prevention**
- Automatically prevents Windows from sleeping
- Keeps sync running even during long operations
- Restores normal sleep when done

### 4. **Graceful Shutdown**
- Press Ctrl+C to safely stop
- Saves checkpoint before exiting
- Resume later without data loss

### 5. **Optimized Queries**
- Caches establishment data
- Pre-calculates academic years
- Bulk lookups instead of individual queries

## üìã How to Use

### 1. First Time Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the SQL helper functions in Supabase
# Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run:
# Copy contents of supabase_sync_helpers.sql
```

### 2. Check Current Status

```bash
python check_sync_status.py
```

This shows:
- Current data counts
- Checkpoint status
- Recent sync logs
- Data health checks
- Progress estimation

### 3. Run Optimized Sync

```bash
# Use the new optimized version
python sync_knack_to_supabase_optimized.py
```

The sync will:
- Prevent your PC from sleeping
- Save checkpoints every batch
- Show detailed progress logs
- Resume from checkpoint if exists

### 4. If Sync Times Out Again

Don't worry! Just run it again:

```bash
python sync_knack_to_supabase_optimized.py
```

It will:
- Load the checkpoint
- Show where it left off
- Continue from that exact point

### 5. Monitor Progress

In another terminal, you can check progress:

```bash
# Check detailed status
python check_sync_status.py

# Watch the log file
tail -f sync_knack_to_supabase.log
```

## üéØ Expected Performance

Based on your current data:
- ~4,158 students
- ~388 establishments
- Full sync should take 10-20 minutes
- Resume from checkpoint: 5-10 minutes

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "PC went to sleep" 
**Fixed!** The optimized script prevents sleep automatically.

### "Timeout errors"
**Fixed!** Batch processing reduces API calls. Built-in retry logic handles network issues.

### "Lost progress"
**Fixed!** Checkpoint system saves progress continuously.

### "Memory issues"
**Fixed!** Processes data in small batches instead of loading everything.

## üìä Understanding Your Data

Your current counts suggest the sync was partially successful:
- ‚úÖ 388 establishments (likely complete)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 4,158 students (might be incomplete)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 2,189 VESPA scores (definitely incomplete - should be ~12,000+)
- ‚ùå 0 question responses (not synced yet)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Run the optimized sync** to completion
2. **Verify data** using `check_sync_status.py`
3. **Test the dashboard** with the new data
4. **Set up scheduled syncs** (see below)

## ‚è∞ Automated Syncing

Once working, set up a scheduled task:

### Windows Task Scheduler

1. Create `run_sync.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
cd /d "C:\Users\tonyd\OneDrive - 4Sight Education Ltd\Apps\DASHBOARD\DASHBOARD"
python sync_knack_to_supabase_optimized.py
```

2. Schedule it to run every 6 hours when PC is on

### Or use Python scheduler

Create `scheduled_sync.py`:
```python
import schedule
import time
import subprocess

def run_sync():
    subprocess.run(["python", "sync_knack_to_supabase_optimized.py"])

# Schedule sync every 6 hours
schedule.every(6).hours.do(run_sync)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Best time to sync**: When you won't need your PC for 20-30 minutes
2. **Network**: Ensure stable internet connection
3. **Power**: Keep laptop plugged in during sync
4. **First sync**: Will take longest, subsequent syncs are faster

## üìû Still Having Issues?

1. Check the log file: `sync_knack_to_supabase.log`
2. Run status check: `python check_sync_status.py`
3. Clear checkpoint to start fresh: Delete `sync_checkpoint.pkl`
4. Check Supabase dashboard for any API limits

Remember: The sync is now resilient! Even if something goes wrong, you can always resume from where it stopped.
