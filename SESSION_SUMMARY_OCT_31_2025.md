# Dashboard Session Summary - October 31, 2025

## 🎯 Session Overview

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Duration:** Full day session (following 4 hours troubleshooting Oct 30)  
**Status:** ✅ Dashboard working, new sync created (needs deduplication fix)

---

## 📊 Starting Point (This Morning)

### **Problems:**
- ❌ Dashboard showing NO data
- ❌ Academic year dropdown empty
- ❌ QLA page completely blank
- ❌ Previous AI broke working system with format changes

### **Root Cause Identified:**
Previous AI changed backend API format but didn't rebuild frontend:
- Backend returned: `["2024/2025"]` 
- Frontend expected: `["2024-25"]`
- Nothing matched → empty dashboard

---

## ✅ What We Fixed Today

### **1. Academic Year Format Mismatch** ✅
**Changes:**
- Rebuilt Vue frontend to send `2025/2026` format
- Fixed `calculate_national_averages.py` (lines 112 & 831)
- Deployed frontend to GitHub CDN
- Deployed backend to Heroku

**Result:** Academic year dropdown now works, shows `["2025/2026", "2024/2025", "2023/2024"]`

---

### **2. National Statistics Table Protection** ✅
**Problem:** Sync was deleting `national_statistics` then failing to recalculate

**Solution:**
- Disabled buggy `calculate_national_statistics()` call in main sync
- Proper calculation still runs via Heroku scheduled job (2 AM daily)
- Added placeholder records to restore dropdown

**Result:** Dropdown works, table protected from future deletions

---

### **3. QLA Empty Page** ✅
**Problem:** QLA relied on pre-aggregated tables that didn't exist for 2025/2026

**Solution:**
- Modified app.py to calculate from raw `question_responses` when pre-aggregated tables empty
- Fixed `formatted_year` consistency bug

**Result:** QLA now displays data (top/bottom questions, insights)

---

## 📈 Current Data State (Ashlyns School 2025/2026)

### **What Supabase Has:**
- Students: 465 ✅
- VESPA Scores (C1): 465 ✅  
- Question Responses (C1): **12,672 from 396 students** ✅ (confirmed by SQL)

### **What Frontend Shows:**
- Total Students: 465 ✅
- Responses: 396 ✅
- **But QLA n number: 161** ❌ (should be 396)

### **The Issue:**
Backend app.py has a pagination bug - only fetching ~160 students instead of all 396 when calculating QLA statistics.

---

## 🚀 New Sync Script Created

### **File:** `sync_current_year_only.py`

### **Concept:**
- ✅ Only syncs CURRENT academic year (2025/2026)
- ✅ Date filters at Knack API level (field_855, field_856)
- ✅ Email-based matching (no field_792 dependency)
- ✅ Academic year constant (set once at start)
- ✅ Protects historical data (never touched)
- ✅ Much faster (~10 min vs 4 hours)

### **Test Run Results:**
```
Students synced: 9,878 ✅
VESPA scores synced: 29,629 ✅
Question responses: Started but hit duplicate error ❌
```

### **Issue Found:**
Duplicate constraint violation - batch contains same question response multiple times. Needs deduplication logic before insert.

---

## 🔧 Remaining Issues

### **1. QLA Pagination Bug (Backend)**
- API only returns n=161 instead of 396
- app.py hitting Supabase query limits
- Need to fix batch querying in QLA endpoint

### **2. QLA Filters Broken**
- Year Group filter doesn't work
- Group filter only shows some groups
- Cycle filter shows non-existent cycles

### **3. New Sync Needs Deduplication**
- Batch can contain duplicate question responses
- Need to deduplicate before upsert
- Then test full run

### **4. Historical Data Missing**
- 2024/2025 only has 144/360 students
- Due to old sync field_792 failures
- Not critical (archive data)

---

## 💡 Key Discoveries

### **Field_792 Connection Issues:**
1. Only 368/27,267 records in Knack have empty field_792 (~1%)
2. But Knack API returns 22% empty in recent records
3. This caused 81.4% skip rate in old sync
4. Email-based matching (new sync) bypasses this completely

### **Data Integrity:**
- Your SQL queries are correct - data IS in Supabase
- Frontend correctly displays what backend provides
- n number discrepancy is backend calculation bug, not data loss

### **Sync Strategy:**
- Current-year-only approach is cleaner and safer
- Protects historical data
- Faster and more reliable
- Eliminates multi-year complexity

## 📦 Commits Made Today

1. **Fix national averages format** (calculate_national_averages.py)
2. **Rebuild Vue frontend** with academic year fix
3. **Fix QLA empty page** (calculate from raw when needed)
4. **Fix QLA formatted_year bug** (consistency)
5. **Protect national_statistics** (disable buggy deletion)
6. **Create new sync_current_year_only.py** (Version 3.0)

All pushed to GitHub and deployed to Heroku ✅

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Immediate (Next Session):**
1. Add deduplication to new sync script
2. Fix QLA pagination bug (backend)
3. Test new sync end-to-end
4. Verify Ashlyns shows n=396

### **Soon:**
1. Fix QLA filters (year group, group, faculty)
2. Fix cycle filter showing non-existent data
3. Deploy new sync to replace old one
4. Update Heroku scheduler to use new sync

### **Later:**
1. Add comprehensive error handling
2. Create sync comparison tool
3. Build monitoring dashboard
4. Document new sync architecture
