# CURRENT SYNC STATUS - August 1, 2025

## THE FILE TO USE:
**`sync_knack_to_supabase_production_fixed.py`**

This is your COMPLETE production sync script that includes:
- ✅ All tables (establishments, students, VESPA, questions, staff, statistics)
- ✅ The PROVEN approach for question_responses (clears first, then syncs)
- ✅ All performance fixes (chunked queries, batch size 1000)
- ✅ All data fixes (date formatting, HTML email extraction, is_australian caching)
- ✅ System sleep prevention
- ✅ Fixed sync_logs table structure

## TO RUN A CLEAN SYNC:

### Step 1: Clear all data (if needed)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor
TRUNCATE TABLE 
    question_responses,
    vespa_scores,
    school_statistics,
    question_statistics,
    national_statistics,
    students,
    establishments,
    staff_admins,
    super_users,
    sync_logs
CASCADE;
```

### Step 2: Run the sync
```bash
python sync_knack_to_supabase_production_fixed.py
```

## EXPECTED RESULTS:
- ~160 establishments (including Belfast Met now that it's uncancelled)
- ~25,000 students
- ~28,000 VESPA scores
- ~754,000 question responses (based on your calculations)
- Staff and super users
- Calculated statistics

## ESTIMATED TIME:
- 30-45 minutes total with the optimized batch processing

## FILES CREATED DURING TROUBLESHOOTING:
(You can ignore/delete these - they were for testing)
- sync_knack_to_supabase_production.py (earlier version with issues)
- Various debug/test scripts
- SQL fix scripts already applied

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: 95%
The script now uses the exact approach that successfully synced 750k records before!
