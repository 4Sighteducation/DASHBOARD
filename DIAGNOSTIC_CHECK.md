# Diagnostic: What Changed Between Yesterday and Today?

**Date:** October 30, 2025

## üîç **Key Question:**
If QLA was working YESTERDAY without frontend changes, what broke TODAY?

---

## üìã **Things to Check:**

### 1. **Did Last Night's Sync Change Data?**

**Sync Report:** `sync_report_20251030_074044.txt`
- Started: Oct 30, 2025 at 7:40 AM
- Question Responses: Added 160, Skipped 702

**SQL to check:**
```sql
-- Check when question responses were last modified for Ashlyns
SELECT 
    academic_year,
    cycle,
    DATE(created_at) as creation_date,
    COUNT(*) as responses,
    COUNT(DISTINCT student_id) as students
FROM question_responses qr
JOIN students s ON qr.student_id = s.id
WHERE s.establishment_id = '308cc905-c1c9-4b71-b976-dfe4d8c7d7ec'
GROUP BY academic_year, cycle, DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY creation_date DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**If responses were created/modified TODAY:** The sync might have changed academic_year values

---

### 2. **What Format is Frontend Currently Using?**

**Without my changes**, the Vue dashboard would:
1. Calculate: `getCurrentAcademicYear()` ‚Üí `"2025-26"`
2. Send filter: `?academic_year=2025-26`
3. Backend receives: `"2025-26"`
4. Backend converts: `"2025-26"` ‚Üí `"2025/2026"` (via `convert_academic_year_format()`)
5. Query: `WHERE academic_year = '2025/2026'`
6. **This WOULD work!**

**So the OLD code should actually work!**

---

## üí° **Possible Explanations:**

### Option A: Data Changed Overnight
- Last night's sync (7:40 AM) modified academic_year values
- Some responses got reassigned to wrong years
- Yesterday's data was correct, today's isn't

### Option B: API Endpoint Changed
- Someone modified `app.py` recently
- The format conversion logic broke
- Check git history: `git log --oneline app.py`

### Option C: Frontend State Issue
- Browser cache showing old data yesterday
- Today's fresh load reveals the real issue
- Need to clear cache and test

### Option D: My Analysis Was Wrong
- The format conversion in `app.py` is actually working fine
- The real issue is something else entirely
- Need to check actual network requests

---

## üß™ **Browser Console Test:**

Have the user open browser DevTools and run:

```javascript
// Check what the frontend is calculating
const store = window.__vueDashboardApp?.$pinia.state.value.dashboard;
console.log('Current academic year from store:', store?.filters?.academicYear);

// Check what the API returns
fetch('https://vespa-dashboard-9a1f84ee5341.herokuapp.com/api/academic-years')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log('API returns:', data));

// Check what's being sent in requests
// (Look at Network tab ‚Üí XHR ‚Üí Check query params)
```

---

## üéØ **Next Steps:**

### Before Rebuilding Frontend:

1. **Check git history:**
   ```bash
   cd DASHBOARD-Vue
   git log --oneline --since="2 days ago" src/stores/dashboard.js
   ```

2. **Check app.py history:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --since="2 days ago" -- app.py
   ```

3. **Test current API:**
   ```bash
   curl "https://vespa-dashboard-9a1f84ee5341.herokuapp.com/api/academic-years"
   ```

4. **Browser test:**
   - Open dashboard in browser
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
   - Reload page
   - Check `/api/qla` request
   - What are the query parameters being sent?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Wait Before Deploying:**

If the frontend was working yesterday, then:
- The OLD frontend code might be correct
- My changes might not be needed
- Or might even BREAK things

**Let's confirm what actually changed first!**
